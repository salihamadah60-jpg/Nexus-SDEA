# Nexus AI Sovereign IDE v8.0 — Silent Operator

## Phase 13.7 — Stuck-Synthesis Root Cause + Mobile Terminal + Pre-Preview Health Gate (2026-04-28)

| # | Fix | Files | Why |
|---|-----|-------|-----|
| 1 | **Vite watch ignore for runtime artifacts** (root cause of "stuck on NEURAL SYNTHESIS") | `vite.config.ts` | The Vite dev server was watching `.nexus/checkpoints/`, `sandbox/`, `.local/`, and `attached_assets/`. Every checkpoint write the autopilot made — and there are MANY during a generation — fired a full HMR page reload of the IDE itself, severing the user's in-flight EventSource. The chat appeared to "freeze on NEURAL SYNTHESIS IN PROGRESS..." until TCP timeout. Now `server.watch.ignored` excludes all four runtime directories. Confirmed in logs: previous boot had 9 reload-spam lines + tsconfig storm; new boot has zero. |
| 2 | **90-second hard ceiling on the synthesis stage** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | Defense-in-depth: even if a single AI provider hangs (Gemini Flash occasionally stalls), the `Promise.race` against a 90s timeout guarantees the chat stream always resolves with either real content or a clear "providers responding slowly — try again" message. No more silent multi-minute waits. |
| 3 | **Mobile terminal layout** | `src/components/TerminalPanel.tsx` | Phone screenshots showed the terminal block (#212333 Moonlight bg) overlapping the chat input bar, line numbers wrapping into the content column, and 12px text being uncomfortably large on narrow viewports. Fixes: padding `px-2 py-2` on mobile (was `p-4`), text sized `text-[10px] sm:text-[12px]`, line-number column `w-4 sm:w-6`, gap `gap-1.5 sm:gap-3`, input row sticky-bottom with `pb-[max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom),12px)]` so the prompt never disappears under the chat bar, and `min-w-0` on the content span for proper overflow break. |
| 4 | **Pre-preview body health scan** (preview opens too early → addressed) | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | The previous READY gate confirmed only "a process is listening on the port", which Vite satisfies even when the bundler crashed (the body contains an inlined error overlay). New `inspectPreviewHealth()` fetches up to 256 KB of the served body and scans for 8 error markers — `vite-error-overlay`, `[vite] Internal/Pre-transform error`, `Failed to compile`, `SyntaxError`, `Cannot find module`, `Module not found`, `ReferenceError`, `ECONNREFUSED` — plus empty-body detection. The autopilot now broadcasts `__OPEN_PREVIEW__` ONLY after BOTH the HTTP probe passes AND the body is clean. If the body is unhealthy, status reverts to STARTING with a clear "Hold on — fixing the issue before opening the preview" message in the journal, and the preview stays closed until self-healing completes. |

## Phase 13.6 — Memory of Wins + SSE Stream Fix + Bilingual Hardening (2026-04-28)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Memory of Wins (Design Library)** | `src/services/winsLibraryService.ts` (new), `src/services/autopilotService.ts`, `src/services/aiService.ts` | New `winsLibraryService` persists every Visual-Auditor verdict ≥ 85 to `.nexus/wins.json` (capped at 30 entries by `score + recency` weighting). Each win stores the user goal that produced it, the verdict summary, tokenized tags for jaccard match, and up to 6 file excerpts (path + first 1.5 KB + byte size). The autopilot's self-improvement loop calls `recordWin` immediately after a design clears the 75-threshold, fetching the latest user message from MongoDB to label the intent. Every chat handler now calls `lookupRelevantWins(userGoal, 3)` before building the system prompt and appends matching wins as a `PROVEN PATTERNS — YOUR PAST WINS` block. Result: the model gets concrete reference material from its own ≥85-scoring outputs every time it generates, instead of starting from a blank canvas. |
| 2 | **SSE early-exit stream-leak fix** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | The Clarification-Bridge branch (line ~973) `return`ed without writing `[DONE]` or calling `res.end()`, leaving the EventSource open until TCP timeout — visible to the user as "thinking forever, then sudden disconnect". This fired most often when all AI providers were rate-limited (empty response → short summary → early-exit). Now the branch always closes the stream cleanly with a real summary (or a graceful "couldn't reach an AI provider" message when the response is empty). |
| 3 | **Bilingual language directive** | `src/services/intentService.ts`, `src/services/aiService.ts` | Added `detectUserLanguage(msg)` (Arabic vs English by character ratio) and `languageDirective(msg)` which returns a strong "reply in this language" block. The chat handler injects it into the system prompt for EVERY turn (not just smalltalk). The Arabic directive explicitly allows technical Latin tokens (file paths, framework names, acronyms) and forbids Cyrillic/CJK/Hangul/Hebrew injection. |
| 4 | **Smarter language sanitizer** | `src/services/intentService.ts` (`sanitizeLanguage`) | Previously stripped ALL Latin letters from Arabic replies, which destroyed file paths like `src/App.tsx` mid-sentence. Now preserves "technical tokens" (anything containing `/._-`, ALL-CAPS acronyms, CamelCase identifiers, or known tech keywords) while still removing prose English words from Arabic replies. Punctuation spacing also normalised. |
| 5 | **Screenshot URL fallback** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (AI-triggered screenshot path) | Previously hit only `/api/preview/<sid>/` (live dev server) and silently returned null when the dev server wasn't booted yet. Now tries the live proxy first, then falls back to the static `/sandbox-preview/<sid>/index.html` route, and emits a clear "preview not reachable yet" status when both fail. |
| 6 | **Language event in stream** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | Added `nexus_lang: "ar" | "en"` to the per-turn streaming event so the UI can render the chat bubble RTL when needed. |

## Phase 13.4 — Visual Self-Improvement Loop (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **`requestVisualRevision` writer call** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` | Converts a `VisualVerdict` (score + categorized issues + recommendations) into a structured issue list and pipes the failing UI files through `requestAuditFix` (cascade: GitHub gpt-4o → Gemini → Groq). The instruction set re-asserts the Quality Bar (≥6 sections, real `@theme` palette, framer-motion, lucide icons, ≥6 depth signals, ≥10 responsive classes, semantic HTML, ≥40-line components) so the writer doesn't regress to placeholder copy. |
| 2 | **`readSandboxUiFiles` collector** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` | Reads up to 8 UI candidates per session: `src/App.{tsx,jsx}`, `src/index.css`, and `src/components/*.{tsx,jsx}`. Skips files >12 KB to keep prompt size manageable. Returns the `{ path, content }[]` shape the writer expects. |
| 3 | **Self-Improvement Loop in autopilot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` (`performVisualAudit`) | Replaced the one-shot vision audit with a closed feedback loop. After each screenshot, the auditor scores the design; if `score < 75` and `visualRevisionAttempts < 2`, the autopilot reads the sandbox UI files, asks the writer to revise them with the verdict as the brief, writes the revised files back (Vite HMR picks them up), waits 5 s for recompile, captures a fresh screenshot named `audit-revision-N.png`, and re-audits. Capped at 2 revision passes per boot to prevent ping-ponging. The journal logs each pass with colour-coded scores (green ≥80, cyan ≥75, amber ≥50, red <50) and broadcasts `__VISUAL_VERDICT__:<json>` events with the pass index for the Self-Healing panel. |
| 4 | **Loop tracking on SessionProcess** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | Added `visualRevisionAttempts` and `bestVisualScore` to the per-session state plus the constants `VISUAL_REVISION_THRESHOLD = 75` and `MAX_VISUAL_REVISIONS = 2`. Both initializers updated to default the counters to 0. The cap survives across the audit attempts within a single boot. |

## Phase 13.3 — Visual Auditor (vision-model design grader) (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Visual Auditor service** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` (new) | After the dev server boots and the puppeteer screenshot is captured, this service reads the PNG (≤8 MB), base64-encodes it, and sends it to Gemini 2.0 Flash multimodal with a strict senior-product-designer prompt. The model returns JSON: `{ score, summary, wins[], issues[{severity,category,message}], recommendations[] }`. Categories: layout, typography, color, imagery, copy, polish, accessibility. Hard rules in the system prompt (blank page ≤20, placeholder copy ≤35, flat single-section ≤50, only beautiful dense launches earn 80+) keep the grading honest. Cascades through the gemini key pool, returns null on failure so it never breaks the autopilot. |
| 2 | **Wired into autopilot post-screenshot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` (`performVisualAudit`) | Immediately after `captureVisualSnapshot` succeeds, the auditor is invoked as a fire-and-forget IIFE — never blocks the dev server from going READY. The verdict is colour-coded into the journal (green ≥80, cyan ≥70, amber ≥50, red <50) with score, summary, top wins, top high-severity issues, and top recommendations. A structured `__VISUAL_VERDICT__:<json>` broadcast lets the existing Self-Healing panel render the full verdict card. |
| 3 | **Verdict format helper** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` (`formatVerdictForJournal`) | Compact one-line summary plus indented bullets — "Wins:", "Top issues:", "Next:" — so the terminal journal is readable without scrolling. |

## Phase 13.2 — Quality Verdict Reviewer + Plan-First Protocol (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Quality Verdict service** | `src/services/qualityVerdictService.ts` (new) | Static-analysis grader that scores every batch of AI-generated files 0–100 against an 11-check rubric: forbidden placeholder phrases, ≥3 numeric/stat claims in copy, real `@theme { --color-* }` block in CSS, ≥6 sections for landing pages, framer-motion imported + ≥3 `<motion.*>` elements, lucide-react in ≥2 files, ≥6 visual-depth signals (gradients/shadow-xl/backdrop-blur/ring), ≥10 responsive classes, semantic HTML, real interactivity, and no stub-sized components (<40 lines). Pure regex — no extra LLM call. Returns a structured `QualityVerdict` with weighted score, failed checks, and a feedback string formatted for re-feeding to the writer model. |
| 2 | **`requestQualityRevision` auto-revision pass** | `src/services/qualityVerdictService.ts` | When the verdict scores below 70, pipes the failing checks through `requestAuditFix` (cascade: GitHub gpt-4o → Gemini 2.0 → Groq) and merges the revised files back into the write batch — overrides by path, appends new files. One revision pass max to keep latency low. |
| 3 | **Verdict wired into orchestrator** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | The Quality Verdict runs immediately after the existing Logic Audit + Self-Correction block and BEFORE the file-write loop, so a failing verdict triggers ONE AI revision without burning a write/restart cycle. The score, pass/fail, and failed check labels are persisted to history (action: `quality_verdict`) and surfaced to the SSE journal. After a revision pass the files are re-graded and the score delta is broadcast. |
| 4 | **System-prompt grading contract** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | New "QUALITY VERDICT — YOU ARE BEING GRADED" section explicitly tells the AI which 11 static checks the reviewer runs, that scores below 70 trigger a revision pass logged as a quality regression, and that it must satisfy ALL checks in the FIRST emission instead of relying on revision to bail it out. Creates pressure to ship right the first time. |
| 5 | **Plan-First Protocol** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | Mandatory THOUGHT-block contents before any non-trivial generation: (1) product name + tagline, (2) 4-6 hex palette to put in `@theme`, (3) full file map with one-line purposes, (4) ordered section list for landing pages, (5) one consolidated `npm install` line. Forces deliberate composition instead of free-association. A THOUGHT block missing any of the five items is itself a quality regression. |
| 6 | **Tiered model promotion** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`selectTieredModel`) | The previous tier router only escalated for words like "architecture"/"refactor", so "build me a beautiful landing page" stayed on the cheap tier. Now ANY generative keyword (build, create, make, design, landing, website, app, component, beautiful, modern, premium, etc.) OR `mode === 'coding'` OR a message > 80 chars routes to the high-reasoning tier (Gemini 2.0 → cascades to GitHub gpt-4o for the writer pass). The cheap tier is now reserved for chit-chat. |

## Phase 13.1 — Quality Bar, Loop Guard, Manifest Healer (2026-04-27)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **`autoFixCommand` heals "Missing script: test"** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | When a generated project crashes with `npm ERR! Missing script: "test"`, the autoFixCommand now reads the project's `package.json`, injects `"test": "vitest run"` (and adds `vitest@^2.1.4` to devDependencies if absent), and re-runs the test command. Replaces a previous infinite "test → fail → test" loop. |
| 2 | **Real React stub generation** | `src/services/importReifierService.ts` | `generateStub()` for `.tsx`/`.jsx` paths now emits a real default-exported React component returning `null` (not `export {};`), so missing-import auto-stubbing no longer breaks Vite's React refresh boundary check. |
| 3 | **No-op file-write guard** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | Before writing a file the AI proposed, the orchestrator reads the existing content; if it's byte-identical to the new content the write is skipped. This prevents chokidar from triggering a Vite restart loop when the AI re-emits the same file across self-correction passes. |
| 4 | **Vitest baked into scaffold** | `src/services/scaffoldService.ts` | The `react-vite` template now ships with `vitest@^2.1.4`, a `vitest.config.ts` (jsdom env + setup file), and `"test": "vitest run"` in package.json, so a freshly scaffolded project never crashes on the test gate. |
| 5 | **Manifest Healer service** | `src/services/manifestHealerService.ts` (new), `src/services/aiService.ts` | After every AI write batch, `healManifest(projectDir)` runs *before* diagnostics: ensures `"type": "module"`, bumps `vite` to `^6.2.0` if `<5`, deletes any stray `tailwind.config.{js,ts,cjs}` (Tailwind v4 reads tokens from CSS `@theme`, not JS), strips broken `@import "tailwindcss/v4"` lines, and rewrites server.port from `5000` (reserved for the IDE itself) to `3001`. Eliminates the most common AI-generated boot crashes without another LLM round-trip. |
| 6 | **Loop Guard in Autopilot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | `SessionProcess` now captures the dev process's last 4 KB of stderr. On each crash during STARTING, the close handler distills error/throw lines into a normalized signature (paths/numbers/timestamps stripped). If two consecutive attempts share the same signature, autopilot aborts with `[LOOP-GUARD]` instead of burning all `MAX_ATTEMPTS` on the same deterministic bug. |
| 7 | **Quality Bar in System Prompt** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | Added a non-negotiable Quality Bar with a forbidden-output blacklist ("Streamline Your Workflow", 17-line Heros, flat solid sections, hardcoded `bg-primary` without `@theme`) and a 10-point checklist (specific copy with numbers, 4-6 brand colors in `@theme`, 6+ rich sections, framer-motion entrance + scroll animations, lucide icons everywhere, gradient depth, responsive breakpoints, semantic HTML, working interactivity, minimum component sizes). Stack rules now explicitly forbid `vite@^4`, require `"type": "module"`, and forbid hand-written `tailwind.config.*` for Tailwind v4. |
| 8 | **Healed broken sandbox** | `sandbox/projects/session-1777224332222-qvn7p4/` | Direct in-place repair of the user's stuck project: rewrote `package.json` with `"type":"module"` + `vite@^6.2.0` + framer-motion/lucide/clsx/tailwind-merge, removed the bad `tailwind.config.js`, deleted stale `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` so a clean install can run. |

## Phase 13 — Chat UX & Preview Fixes (2026-04-27)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Preview proxy fixed** | `src/config/middleware.ts` | Removed a hardcoded `http-proxy-middleware` rule pointing at `localhost:3001` that intercepted every `/api/preview/:sessionId` request before the dynamic port proxy in `server.ts` could handle it, causing "Preview server not running on port 3001" on every session. Now the dynamic proxy in `server.ts` (which reads `session.port` at request time) is the sole handler. |
| 2 | **Vite port-drift race fixed** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | `performVisualAudit` was called when the `"ready in"` line appeared — a chunk that arrives *before* the `"Local: http://localhost:PORT/"` line. The port hadn't been detected yet, so the audit probed the wrong port. Now the audit only fires on the `Local:/Network:/Available on:` line, which always carries the confirmed port. |
| 3 | **Buttons always visible** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` | Changed action-row opacity from `opacity-0 hover:opacity-100` (invisible on mobile/touch) to `opacity-40 hover:opacity-100`. All file Open buttons in `ReadFileGroup` and `WriteFileCard` changed from `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` to always-visible. |
| 4 | **13.7 Action Groups** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` | Added `ActionGroupChip` component that collapses all tool-call cards (file reads, file writes, terminals, screenshot) into a single `"N actions ▸"` chip. Collapsed by default; auto-expanded when there are terminal failures. Replaces the previous individual expanded cards in `NexusMessageBubble`, fixing the formatting-change-on-reload issue (previously cards appeared expanded after session reload). |
| 5 | **View Diff button** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/types.ts`, `src/services/aiService.ts` | `WriteFileCard` now shows a **Diff** button when `beforeContent` is available. Clicking opens `DiffModal`, which fetches the current file content from `/api/files/content` and renders a unified line diff (deletions in red, insertions in green). `aiService.ts` now reads the old file content before writing and includes it as `beforeContent` in the `nexus_file_write` SSE event. `FileWriteEntry` type extended with `beforeContent?: string`. |

## Phase 12.8 — Self-Healing History Panel (2026-04-26)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 18 | **Self-Healing Panel** | `SelfHealingPanel.tsx`, `NavigationRail.tsx`, `NexusCore.tsx` | New sidebar panel accessible via the ShieldCheck icon in session mode. Parses two live sources: (1) terminal journal lines for AUTOPILOT Vite/CSS healer events, (2) SSE `statusHistory` from chat messages for Reviewer audit events. Displays structured HealEvent rows (pass type, status, filename, detail), a 6-stat summary bar (healed/failed/pattern/AI/audit/total), and a live success-rate badge. Auto-scrolls, supports clear, expandable detail rows. Failed AI Healer events show a **Retry Fix** button that calls `POST /api/kernel/heal/retry`, re-runs `requestAIFileFix`, writes the corrected file to disk, and overlays the row with the new outcome inline. |
| 20 | **`POST /api/kernel/heal/retry`** | `sovereign.ts` | New endpoint: reads the file from the sandbox (path-traversal safe), calls `requestAIFileFix(filePath, content, errorHint)`, writes the corrected content back, and returns `{ success, filePath, detail }`. |
| 19 | **Real Dependency Audit Gate** | `aiService.ts` | Replaced the 800ms fake delay with a real `npm audit --json --audit-level=high` execution. Parses vulnerability JSON, surfaces high/critical package names and count to the journal stream before install proceeds. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Phase 12.7 — AI Self-Healing Loop)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 13 | **Pre-write audit feedback loop completed** | `aiService.ts`, `orchestratorService.ts` | The stub at line 848 ("We'd normally call the LLM again here") is now a real self-correction pass. When `performLogicAudit()` fails, `requestAuditFix()` sends the files + issues to a fast AI (Groq→Gemini), merges the corrections back into `parsed.filesToWrite`, and continues. Broken files are no longer written to disk. |
| 14 | **Vite runtime AI self-healer** | `autopilotService.ts`, `orchestratorService.ts` | `autoFixVitePreTransformError` now has a two-pass strategy: (1) instant pattern fix for CSS `//` comments, (2) AI-powered fix via `requestAIFileFix()` for all other Vite/TypeScript errors. The fixed file is written back and Vite HMR reloads it without a restart. |
| 15 | **`autoFixCommand` expanded** | `aiService.ts` | Added 5 new patterns: missing module (extracts package name + `npm install`), missing `@scope/pkg` paths, `ENOTFOUND`/network retry with `--prefer-offline`, `EACCES` + `--unsafe-perm`, TypeScript errors in build command (strips `tsc &&` and falls through to Vite). |
| 16 | **SOVEREIGN DEBUGGER stub replaced** | `aiService.ts` | The hollow `console.warn('Analyzing stack trace...')` is replaced with a real error-line extractor that surfaces the relevant error + attempted fix in structured log output. |
| 17 | **`requestAIFileFix` + `requestAuditFix`** | `orchestratorService.ts` | Two new exported helpers. `requestAIFileFix(filePath, content, error)` asks a fast AI to repair a single file and return the raw fixed content. `requestAuditFix(files, issues, goal)` asks AI to regenerate failing files after an audit. Both cascade Groq→Gemini with key-pool rotation. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Phase 12.6 — CSS Error Detection & Auto-Fix)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 9 | **CSS `//` comment crash** | `aiService.ts` | AI was writing `// comment @import "tailwindcss"` in CSS — invalid CSS that crashes Tailwind v4 Vite plugin. `sanitizeCssContent()` strips all `//` lines/prefixes from `.css` files before they are written to disk. |
| 10 | **System prompt CSS rule** | `aiService.ts` | Added explicit ⚠️ CRITICAL CSS RULE to system prompt: CSS never uses `//` comments; `@import "tailwindcss"` must be first line with nothing before it. |
| 11 | **Vite pre-transform auto-fix** | `autopilotService.ts` | Autopilot stderr handler now detects `Pre-transform error`/`Invalid declaration`. Calls `autoFixVitePreTransformError()` which parses the offending file path from the error, strips `//` comments, rewrites the file, and lets Vite HMR recover without a restart. |
| 12 | **Post-build CSS diagnostics** | `diagnosticService.ts` | `runDiagnostics()` now scans all `.css` files in the sandbox for invalid `//` comments and auto-fixes them before the dev server starts, giving a third line of defence. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Pre-Phase 12.5 Session)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Port conflicts** | `portService.ts` | Removed shell command substitution (`kill -9 $(lsof ...)`). All kills now use typed `findPidsOnPort + killPid` APIs. Clean 4-retry reclaim loop, deterministic fallback scan. |
| 2 | **E2B sandbox check** | `e2bService.ts`, `/api/health` | E2B is active only when `E2B_API_KEY` is set. Terminal + preview are always local. `/api/health` reports `sandbox: "e2b" \| "local"`. |
| 3 | **Nexus creation behavior** | `aiService.ts`, `scaffoldService.ts` | System prompt hardened with FORBIDDEN PHRASES list. Model must write ALL files in ONE response — no "I will start creating…" preamble. Scaffold updated to Tailwind v4. |
| 4 | **EAGAIN / process limit** | `autopilotService.ts` | Removed `shell: true` from all `spawn()` calls — this was creating an extra `sh -c` process per install/dev-server, doubling process count. Added `EAGAIN`/`ENOMEM` error handlers with back-off retries. |
| 5 | **Visual Audit Fail** | `autopilotService.ts` | Reduced retry loop from 10 → 3 attempts. Early-exit when `captureVisualSnapshot` returns null (no browser binary) — no more 10-cycle "no browser" spam. |
| 6 | **Core Dumped** | `visualService.ts` | Added full set of container-safe Chromium flags: `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, `--no-zygote`, `--single-process`, `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-software-rasterizer`, etc. Added Nix store paths to binary search. |
| 7 | **Vite config ESM Workers** | `vite.config.ts` | Fixed proxy target 3000 → 5000. Added `optimizeDeps.exclude` for `web-tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-wasms`, `better-sqlite3`. Added `worker.format: 'es'`. |
| 8 | **Phase 12.5** | `autopilotService.ts`, `api.ts` | `getLiveSessions()` cross-checks sandbox dirs against SQLite `sessions` table. Orphan dirs skipped on boot. `POST /api/autopilot/gc` endpoint for manual purge. |

### Additional fixes
- `getProviderClients()` now returns `altAi` (was causing runtime destructuring error)
- Scaffold updated to Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@import "tailwindcss"`, no postcss.config.js)
- `scaffoldService.ts` vite.config no longer uses `strictPort: true` (caused unnecessary EADDRINUSE cascades)

A unified, world-class AI coding IDE built on a sovereign architecture. Nexus builds projects autonomously from A to Z, operates silently (all code written directly to files), and presents clean structured responses with expandable intelligence sections.

## Architecture

**Single-server design:** `server.ts` runs Express on port 5000, embeds Vite dev middleware, and manages all subsystems. Port 5000 is reserved (deterministic single bind, no silent relocation); sandbox projects start at 3001+.

## SDEA Backend Layer (Software Development Engineering Agent)

Nexus's core logic was upgraded to compete with Replit/Cursor/MiniMax-class agents:

- **Key pool rotation** — `keyPoolService` scans env for variants (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_1`, `GAK_2`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ALT_GITHUB_GPT`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, …), dedupes identical secrets, round-robins healthy keys per request, applies exponential cooldowns on 429/quota and hard-disables on 401/403.
- **Intent gating** — `intentService.classifyIntent()` routes "Hello" → 1-line reply, questions → short prose, build/command → full Sovereign protocol (THOUGHT/CHAIN/FILE/TERMINAL/SCREENSHOT). No more spinning up vite for a greeting.
- **Language hygiene** — `sanitizeLanguage()` strips Cyrillic/CJK/Hangul/Devanagari/etc. from outgoing prose when the user wrote in Arabic+Latin only. File contents are never touched.
- **Memory compaction** — `memoryService.compactHistory()` keeps the last 8 turns verbatim and condenses older ones into a digest line, plus a per-session facts table (filesWritten, packagesInstalled, portsUsed, decisions) injected into the prompt to prevent hallucinated file references.
- **Verified preview gate** — `autopilotService` only broadcasts `__OPEN_PREVIEW__` after an HTTP probe returns 2xx/3xx (10 attempts × 1s) — no more 404 flicker.
- **Event bus** — `eventStreamService` exposes Action/Observation events (file.write, file.copy, preview.ready, command.result …) via `GET /api/kernel/events`.

### New REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET    | `/api/kernel/quota`               | Masked snapshot of every key (calls, failures, cooldown remaining, health) |
| GET    | `/api/kernel/memory`              | Session facts (files/packages/ports tracked) |
| DELETE | `/api/kernel/memory/:sessionId`   | Wipe a session's compacted memory |
| GET    | `/api/kernel/events?sessionId=&limit=` | Recent Action/Observation events |
| POST   | `/api/files/copy` `{sessionId,srcPath,destPath,move?}` | Recursive copy or move (cp -R / mv) |
| GET    | `/api/blackboard/tasks?sessionId=` | All blackboard tasks for a session (polled by LiveBlackboardBar every 3s) |
| GET    | `/api/blackboard/task/:id` | Single task with plan steps and audit history |
| GET    | `/api/deploy/readiness` | 6-point pre-deploy checklist (SQLite, DNA, provider keys, MongoDB, stasis tasks, sandbox flavor) |

## Silent Operator Protocol (v7.0)

Nexus AI operates silently — all code is written directly to sandbox files using structured marker format. Chat shows only clean status text, with deep details in expandable sections:

- **Neural Logic** — Nexus's thought process (collapsed by default)
- **Action Chain** — Step-by-step plan (expanded by default)
- **File Context** — Files read + files modified with "View" button to open in editor
- **Ghost Terminal** — Commands executed inline with output, copyable, auto-expanded on error
- **Visual Verification** — Screenshot of preview after build

### AI Response Marker Format

```
[NEXUS:THOUGHT]reasoning[/NEXUS:THOUGHT]
[NEXUS:CHAIN]Step 1: ...|Step 2: ...[/NEXUS:CHAIN]
[NEXUS:READ]filename.ts[/NEXUS:READ]
[NEXUS:FILE:path/to/file.tsx]complete file content[/NEXUS:FILE]
[NEXUS:TERMINAL]npm install[/NEXUS:TERMINAL]
[NEXUS:SCREENSHOT]verify[/NEXUS:SCREENSHOT]
Visible summary text to user (no code blocks)
```

### SSE Event Protocol

Backend sends structured events to frontend:
- `nexus_streaming` — keep-alive ping with status text
- `nexus_thought` — reasoning (goes to Neural Logic accordion)
- `nexus_chain` — action chain steps
- `nexus_file_read` — files analyzed
- `nexus_file_write` — file written to sandbox `{path, size}`
- `nexus_terminal` — command result `{cmd, output, success, retried, fixedCmd}`
- `nexus_screenshot` — visual verification filename
- `nexus_summary` — clean visible text for chat message

## Quad-System Integration

All four systems are hard-linked via WebSocket broadcast signals:

| Signal | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `__REFRESH_FS__` | File Explorer re-scans sandbox |
| `__OPEN_PREVIEW__` | Preview panel opens automatically |
| `__REFRESH_PREVIEW__` | Preview iframe reloads |
| `__VISUAL_SNAPSHOT__:filename` | Snapshot added to gallery |

## Build Protocol A to Z

Nexus follows a 5-phase build protocol for every project:
1. **Analyze** — Scan existing files, understand request
2. **Plan** — Write THOUGHT + CHAIN, report to user
3. **Execute** — Write all files, run terminal commands
4. **Verify** — Screenshot preview, self-correct visual issues
5. **Report** — Summarize what was built

## Terminal Autonomy + Self-Correction

Autopilot and AI service both implement self-correction:
- npm install fails → retry with `--legacy-peer-deps`, then `--force`
- Port in use → autopilot auto-increments port
- Module not found → auto-install the missing package
- Max 3 retry attempts before reporting failure

## Sandbox Isolation

Each session gets a fully isolated sandbox:
- Path: `sandbox/projects/{sessionId}/`
- Shell: dedicated bash process per session
- Path traversal prevention: `guardPath()` on all API endpoints
- Auto-initialization: `Nexus.md` copied on session creation

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 + TypeScript (tsx for dev)
- **Frontend:** React 18, Tailwind v4, motion/react, lucide-react
- **AI Providers:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview → Gemini 2.0 Flash → Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite → GitHub GPT-4o → Groq Llama-3.3-70B → HuggingFace Llama-3.2
- **Editor:** @uiw/react-codemirror + CodeMirror language extensions
- **Color Palette:** `#d4af37` (Nexus Gold), `#00f2ff` (Nexus Cyan), `#050508` (Deep Black)
