# Nexus AI Sovereign IDE v8.0 — Silent Operator

## Phase 13.4 — Visual Self-Improvement Loop (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **`requestVisualRevision` writer call** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` | Converts a `VisualVerdict` (score + categorized issues + recommendations) into a structured issue list and pipes the failing UI files through `requestAuditFix` (cascade: GitHub gpt-4o → Gemini → Groq). The instruction set re-asserts the Quality Bar (≥6 sections, real `@theme` palette, framer-motion, lucide icons, ≥6 depth signals, ≥10 responsive classes, semantic HTML, ≥40-line components) so the writer doesn't regress to placeholder copy. |
| 2 | **`readSandboxUiFiles` collector** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` | Reads up to 8 UI candidates per session: `src/App.{tsx,jsx}`, `src/index.css`, and `src/components/*.{tsx,jsx}`. Skips files >12 KB to keep prompt size manageable. Returns the `{ path, content }[]` shape the writer expects. |
| 3 | **Self-Improvement Loop in autopilot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` (`performVisualAudit`) | Replaced the one-shot vision audit with a closed feedback loop. After each screenshot, the auditor scores the design; if `score < 75` and `visualRevisionAttempts < 2`, the autopilot reads the sandbox UI files, asks the writer to revise them with the verdict as the brief, writes the revised files back (Vite HMR picks them up), waits 5 s for recompile, captures a fresh screenshot named `audit-revision-N.png`, and re-audits. Capped at 2 revision passes per boot to prevent ping-ponging. The journal logs each pass with colour-coded scores (green ≥80, cyan ≥75, amber ≥50, red <50) and broadcasts `__VISUAL_VERDICT__:<json>` events with the pass index for the Self-Healing panel. |
| 4 | **Loop tracking on SessionProcess** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | Added `visualRevisionAttempts` and `bestVisualScore` to the per-session state plus the constants `VISUAL_REVISION_THRESHOLD = 75` and `MAX_VISUAL_REVISIONS = 2`. Both initializers updated to default the counters to 0. The cap survives across the audit attempts within a single boot. |

## Phase 13.3 — Visual Auditor (vision-model design grader) (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Visual Auditor service** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` (new) | After the dev server boots and the puppeteer screenshot is captured, this service reads the PNG (≤8 MB), base64-encodes it, and sends it to Gemini 2.0 Flash multimodal with a strict senior-product-designer prompt. The model returns JSON: `{ score, summary, wins[], issues[{severity,category,message}], recommendations[] }`. Categories: layout, typography, color, imagery, copy, polish, accessibility. Hard rules in the system prompt (blank page ≤20, placeholder copy ≤35, flat single-section ≤50, only beautiful dense launches earn 80+) keep the grading honest. Cascades through the gemini key pool, returns null on failure so it never breaks the autopilot. |
| 2 | **Wired into autopilot post-screenshot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` (`performVisualAudit`) | Immediately after `captureVisualSnapshot` succeeds, the auditor is invoked as a fire-and-forget IIFE — never blocks the dev server from going READY. The verdict is colour-coded into the journal (green ≥80, cyan ≥70, amber ≥50, red <50) with score, summary, top wins, top high-severity issues, and top recommendations. A structured `__VISUAL_VERDICT__:<json>` broadcast lets the existing Self-Healing panel render the full verdict card. |
| 3 | **Verdict format helper** | `src/services/visualAuditorService.ts` (`formatVerdictForJournal`) | Compact one-line summary plus indented bullets — "Wins:", "Top issues:", "Next:" — so the terminal journal is readable without scrolling. |

## Phase 13.2 — Quality Verdict Reviewer + Plan-First Protocol (2026-04-27)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Quality Verdict service** | `src/services/qualityVerdictService.ts` (new) | Static-analysis grader that scores every batch of AI-generated files 0–100 against an 11-check rubric: forbidden placeholder phrases, ≥3 numeric/stat claims in copy, real `@theme { --color-* }` block in CSS, ≥6 sections for landing pages, framer-motion imported + ≥3 `<motion.*>` elements, lucide-react in ≥2 files, ≥6 visual-depth signals (gradients/shadow-xl/backdrop-blur/ring), ≥10 responsive classes, semantic HTML, real interactivity, and no stub-sized components (<40 lines). Pure regex — no extra LLM call. Returns a structured `QualityVerdict` with weighted score, failed checks, and a feedback string formatted for re-feeding to the writer model. |
| 2 | **`requestQualityRevision` auto-revision pass** | `src/services/qualityVerdictService.ts` | When the verdict scores below 70, pipes the failing checks through `requestAuditFix` (cascade: GitHub gpt-4o → Gemini 2.0 → Groq) and merges the revised files back into the write batch — overrides by path, appends new files. One revision pass max to keep latency low. |
| 3 | **Verdict wired into orchestrator** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | The Quality Verdict runs immediately after the existing Logic Audit + Self-Correction block and BEFORE the file-write loop, so a failing verdict triggers ONE AI revision without burning a write/restart cycle. The score, pass/fail, and failed check labels are persisted to history (action: `quality_verdict`) and surfaced to the SSE journal. After a revision pass the files are re-graded and the score delta is broadcast. |
| 4 | **System-prompt grading contract** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | New "QUALITY VERDICT — YOU ARE BEING GRADED" section explicitly tells the AI which 11 static checks the reviewer runs, that scores below 70 trigger a revision pass logged as a quality regression, and that it must satisfy ALL checks in the FIRST emission instead of relying on revision to bail it out. Creates pressure to ship right the first time. |
| 5 | **Plan-First Protocol** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | Mandatory THOUGHT-block contents before any non-trivial generation: (1) product name + tagline, (2) 4-6 hex palette to put in `@theme`, (3) full file map with one-line purposes, (4) ordered section list for landing pages, (5) one consolidated `npm install` line. Forces deliberate composition instead of free-association. A THOUGHT block missing any of the five items is itself a quality regression. |
| 6 | **Tiered model promotion** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`selectTieredModel`) | The previous tier router only escalated for words like "architecture"/"refactor", so "build me a beautiful landing page" stayed on the cheap tier. Now ANY generative keyword (build, create, make, design, landing, website, app, component, beautiful, modern, premium, etc.) OR `mode === 'coding'` OR a message > 80 chars routes to the high-reasoning tier (Gemini 2.0 → cascades to GitHub gpt-4o for the writer pass). The cheap tier is now reserved for chit-chat. |

## Phase 13.1 — Quality Bar, Loop Guard, Manifest Healer (2026-04-27)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **`autoFixCommand` heals "Missing script: test"** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | When a generated project crashes with `npm ERR! Missing script: "test"`, the autoFixCommand now reads the project's `package.json`, injects `"test": "vitest run"` (and adds `vitest@^2.1.4` to devDependencies if absent), and re-runs the test command. Replaces a previous infinite "test → fail → test" loop. |
| 2 | **Real React stub generation** | `src/services/importReifierService.ts` | `generateStub()` for `.tsx`/`.jsx` paths now emits a real default-exported React component returning `null` (not `export {};`), so missing-import auto-stubbing no longer breaks Vite's React refresh boundary check. |
| 3 | **No-op file-write guard** | `src/services/aiService.ts` | Before writing a file the AI proposed, the orchestrator reads the existing content; if it's byte-identical to the new content the write is skipped. This prevents chokidar from triggering a Vite restart loop when the AI re-emits the same file across self-correction passes. |
| 4 | **Vitest baked into scaffold** | `src/services/scaffoldService.ts` | The `react-vite` template now ships with `vitest@^2.1.4`, a `vitest.config.ts` (jsdom env + setup file), and `"test": "vitest run"` in package.json, so a freshly scaffolded project never crashes on the test gate. |
| 5 | **Manifest Healer service** | `src/services/manifestHealerService.ts` (new), `src/services/aiService.ts` | After every AI write batch, `healManifest(projectDir)` runs *before* diagnostics: ensures `"type": "module"`, bumps `vite` to `^6.2.0` if `<5`, deletes any stray `tailwind.config.{js,ts,cjs}` (Tailwind v4 reads tokens from CSS `@theme`, not JS), strips broken `@import "tailwindcss/v4"` lines, and rewrites server.port from `5000` (reserved for the IDE itself) to `3001`. Eliminates the most common AI-generated boot crashes without another LLM round-trip. |
| 6 | **Loop Guard in Autopilot** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | `SessionProcess` now captures the dev process's last 4 KB of stderr. On each crash during STARTING, the close handler distills error/throw lines into a normalized signature (paths/numbers/timestamps stripped). If two consecutive attempts share the same signature, autopilot aborts with `[LOOP-GUARD]` instead of burning all `MAX_ATTEMPTS` on the same deterministic bug. |
| 7 | **Quality Bar in System Prompt** | `src/services/aiService.ts` (`buildSystemPrompt`) | Added a non-negotiable Quality Bar with a forbidden-output blacklist ("Streamline Your Workflow", 17-line Heros, flat solid sections, hardcoded `bg-primary` without `@theme`) and a 10-point checklist (specific copy with numbers, 4-6 brand colors in `@theme`, 6+ rich sections, framer-motion entrance + scroll animations, lucide icons everywhere, gradient depth, responsive breakpoints, semantic HTML, working interactivity, minimum component sizes). Stack rules now explicitly forbid `vite@^4`, require `"type": "module"`, and forbid hand-written `tailwind.config.*` for Tailwind v4. |
| 8 | **Healed broken sandbox** | `sandbox/projects/session-1777224332222-qvn7p4/` | Direct in-place repair of the user's stuck project: rewrote `package.json` with `"type":"module"` + `vite@^6.2.0` + framer-motion/lucide/clsx/tailwind-merge, removed the bad `tailwind.config.js`, deleted stale `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` so a clean install can run. |

## Phase 13 — Chat UX & Preview Fixes (2026-04-27)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Preview proxy fixed** | `src/config/middleware.ts` | Removed a hardcoded `http-proxy-middleware` rule pointing at `localhost:3001` that intercepted every `/api/preview/:sessionId` request before the dynamic port proxy in `server.ts` could handle it, causing "Preview server not running on port 3001" on every session. Now the dynamic proxy in `server.ts` (which reads `session.port` at request time) is the sole handler. |
| 2 | **Vite port-drift race fixed** | `src/services/autopilotService.ts` | `performVisualAudit` was called when the `"ready in"` line appeared — a chunk that arrives *before* the `"Local: http://localhost:PORT/"` line. The port hadn't been detected yet, so the audit probed the wrong port. Now the audit only fires on the `Local:/Network:/Available on:` line, which always carries the confirmed port. |
| 3 | **Buttons always visible** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` | Changed action-row opacity from `opacity-0 hover:opacity-100` (invisible on mobile/touch) to `opacity-40 hover:opacity-100`. All file Open buttons in `ReadFileGroup` and `WriteFileCard` changed from `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` to always-visible. |
| 4 | **13.7 Action Groups** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` | Added `ActionGroupChip` component that collapses all tool-call cards (file reads, file writes, terminals, screenshot) into a single `"N actions ▸"` chip. Collapsed by default; auto-expanded when there are terminal failures. Replaces the previous individual expanded cards in `NexusMessageBubble`, fixing the formatting-change-on-reload issue (previously cards appeared expanded after session reload). |
| 5 | **View Diff button** | `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/types.ts`, `src/services/aiService.ts` | `WriteFileCard` now shows a **Diff** button when `beforeContent` is available. Clicking opens `DiffModal`, which fetches the current file content from `/api/files/content` and renders a unified line diff (deletions in red, insertions in green). `aiService.ts` now reads the old file content before writing and includes it as `beforeContent` in the `nexus_file_write` SSE event. `FileWriteEntry` type extended with `beforeContent?: string`. |

## Phase 12.8 — Self-Healing History Panel (2026-04-26)

| # | Feature | Files | Summary |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 18 | **Self-Healing Panel** | `SelfHealingPanel.tsx`, `NavigationRail.tsx`, `NexusCore.tsx` | New sidebar panel accessible via the ShieldCheck icon in session mode. Parses two live sources: (1) terminal journal lines for AUTOPILOT Vite/CSS healer events, (2) SSE `statusHistory` from chat messages for Reviewer audit events. Displays structured HealEvent rows (pass type, status, filename, detail), a 6-stat summary bar (healed/failed/pattern/AI/audit/total), and a live success-rate badge. Auto-scrolls, supports clear, expandable detail rows. Failed AI Healer events show a **Retry Fix** button that calls `POST /api/kernel/heal/retry`, re-runs `requestAIFileFix`, writes the corrected file to disk, and overlays the row with the new outcome inline. |
| 20 | **`POST /api/kernel/heal/retry`** | `sovereign.ts` | New endpoint: reads the file from the sandbox (path-traversal safe), calls `requestAIFileFix(filePath, content, errorHint)`, writes the corrected content back, and returns `{ success, filePath, detail }`. |
| 19 | **Real Dependency Audit Gate** | `aiService.ts` | Replaced the 800ms fake delay with a real `npm audit --json --audit-level=high` execution. Parses vulnerability JSON, surfaces high/critical package names and count to the journal stream before install proceeds. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Phase 12.7 — AI Self-Healing Loop)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 13 | **Pre-write audit feedback loop completed** | `aiService.ts`, `orchestratorService.ts` | The stub at line 848 ("We'd normally call the LLM again here") is now a real self-correction pass. When `performLogicAudit()` fails, `requestAuditFix()` sends the files + issues to a fast AI (Groq→Gemini), merges the corrections back into `parsed.filesToWrite`, and continues. Broken files are no longer written to disk. |
| 14 | **Vite runtime AI self-healer** | `autopilotService.ts`, `orchestratorService.ts` | `autoFixVitePreTransformError` now has a two-pass strategy: (1) instant pattern fix for CSS `//` comments, (2) AI-powered fix via `requestAIFileFix()` for all other Vite/TypeScript errors. The fixed file is written back and Vite HMR reloads it without a restart. |
| 15 | **`autoFixCommand` expanded** | `aiService.ts` | Added 5 new patterns: missing module (extracts package name + `npm install`), missing `@scope/pkg` paths, `ENOTFOUND`/network retry with `--prefer-offline`, `EACCES` + `--unsafe-perm`, TypeScript errors in build command (strips `tsc &&` and falls through to Vite). |
| 16 | **SOVEREIGN DEBUGGER stub replaced** | `aiService.ts` | The hollow `console.warn('Analyzing stack trace...')` is replaced with a real error-line extractor that surfaces the relevant error + attempted fix in structured log output. |
| 17 | **`requestAIFileFix` + `requestAuditFix`** | `orchestratorService.ts` | Two new exported helpers. `requestAIFileFix(filePath, content, error)` asks a fast AI to repair a single file and return the raw fixed content. `requestAuditFix(files, issues, goal)` asks AI to regenerate failing files after an audit. Both cascade Groq→Gemini with key-pool rotation. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Phase 12.6 — CSS Error Detection & Auto-Fix)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 9 | **CSS `//` comment crash** | `aiService.ts` | AI was writing `// comment @import "tailwindcss"` in CSS — invalid CSS that crashes Tailwind v4 Vite plugin. `sanitizeCssContent()` strips all `//` lines/prefixes from `.css` files before they are written to disk. |
| 10 | **System prompt CSS rule** | `aiService.ts` | Added explicit ⚠️ CRITICAL CSS RULE to system prompt: CSS never uses `//` comments; `@import "tailwindcss"` must be first line with nothing before it. |
| 11 | **Vite pre-transform auto-fix** | `autopilotService.ts` | Autopilot stderr handler now detects `Pre-transform error`/`Invalid declaration`. Calls `autoFixVitePreTransformError()` which parses the offending file path from the error, strips `//` comments, rewrites the file, and lets Vite HMR recover without a restart. |
| 12 | **Post-build CSS diagnostics** | `diagnosticService.ts` | `runDiagnostics()` now scans all `.css` files in the sandbox for invalid `//` comments and auto-fixes them before the dev server starts, giving a third line of defence. |

## Bug Fixes Applied (2026-04-26 — Pre-Phase 12.5 Session)

| # | Fix | Files | Summary |
|---|-----|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Port conflicts** | `portService.ts` | Removed shell command substitution (`kill -9 $(lsof ...)`). All kills now use typed `findPidsOnPort + killPid` APIs. Clean 4-retry reclaim loop, deterministic fallback scan. |
| 2 | **E2B sandbox check** | `e2bService.ts`, `/api/health` | E2B is active only when `E2B_API_KEY` is set. Terminal + preview are always local. `/api/health` reports `sandbox: "e2b" \| "local"`. |
| 3 | **Nexus creation behavior** | `aiService.ts`, `scaffoldService.ts` | System prompt hardened with FORBIDDEN PHRASES list. Model must write ALL files in ONE response — no "I will start creating…" preamble. Scaffold updated to Tailwind v4. |
| 4 | **EAGAIN / process limit** | `autopilotService.ts` | Removed `shell: true` from all `spawn()` calls — this was creating an extra `sh -c` process per install/dev-server, doubling process count. Added `EAGAIN`/`ENOMEM` error handlers with back-off retries. |
| 5 | **Visual Audit Fail** | `autopilotService.ts` | Reduced retry loop from 10 → 3 attempts. Early-exit when `captureVisualSnapshot` returns null (no browser binary) — no more 10-cycle "no browser" spam. |
| 6 | **Core Dumped** | `visualService.ts` | Added full set of container-safe Chromium flags: `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, `--no-zygote`, `--single-process`, `--disable-gpu`, `--disable-software-rasterizer`, etc. Added Nix store paths to binary search. |
| 7 | **Vite config ESM Workers** | `vite.config.ts` | Fixed proxy target 3000 → 5000. Added `optimizeDeps.exclude` for `web-tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-wasms`, `better-sqlite3`. Added `worker.format: 'es'`. |
| 8 | **Phase 12.5** | `autopilotService.ts`, `api.ts` | `getLiveSessions()` cross-checks sandbox dirs against SQLite `sessions` table. Orphan dirs skipped on boot. `POST /api/autopilot/gc` endpoint for manual purge. |

### Additional fixes
- `getProviderClients()` now returns `altAi` (was causing runtime destructuring error)
- Scaffold updated to Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@import "tailwindcss"`, no postcss.config.js)
- `scaffoldService.ts` vite.config no longer uses `strictPort: true` (caused unnecessary EADDRINUSE cascades)

A unified, world-class AI coding IDE built on a sovereign architecture. Nexus builds projects autonomously from A to Z, operates silently (all code written directly to files), and presents clean structured responses with expandable intelligence sections.

## Architecture

**Single-server design:** `server.ts` runs Express on port 5000, embeds Vite dev middleware, and manages all subsystems. Port 5000 is reserved (deterministic single bind, no silent relocation); sandbox projects start at 3001+.

## SDEA Backend Layer (Software Development Engineering Agent)

Nexus's core logic was upgraded to compete with Replit/Cursor/MiniMax-class agents:

- **Key pool rotation** — `keyPoolService` scans env for variants (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY_1`, `GAK_2`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ALT_GITHUB_GPT`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, …), dedupes identical secrets, round-robins healthy keys per request, applies exponential cooldowns on 429/quota and hard-disables on 401/403.
- **Intent gating** — `intentService.classifyIntent()` routes "Hello" → 1-line reply, questions → short prose, build/command → full Sovereign protocol (THOUGHT/CHAIN/FILE/TERMINAL/SCREENSHOT). No more spinning up vite for a greeting.
- **Language hygiene** — `sanitizeLanguage()` strips Cyrillic/CJK/Hangul/Devanagari/etc. from outgoing prose when the user wrote in Arabic+Latin only. File contents are never touched.
- **Memory compaction** — `memoryService.compactHistory()` keeps the last 8 turns verbatim and condenses older ones into a digest line, plus a per-session facts table (filesWritten, packagesInstalled, portsUsed, decisions) injected into the prompt to prevent hallucinated file references.
- **Verified preview gate** — `autopilotService` only broadcasts `__OPEN_PREVIEW__` after an HTTP probe returns 2xx/3xx (10 attempts × 1s) — no more 404 flicker.
- **Event bus** — `eventStreamService` exposes Action/Observation events (file.write, file.copy, preview.ready, command.result …) via `GET /api/kernel/events`.

### New REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET    | `/api/kernel/quota`               | Masked snapshot of every key (calls, failures, cooldown remaining, health) |
| GET    | `/api/kernel/memory`              | Session facts (files/packages/ports tracked) |
| DELETE | `/api/kernel/memory/:sessionId`   | Wipe a session's compacted memory |
| GET    | `/api/kernel/events?sessionId=&limit=` | Recent Action/Observation events |
| POST   | `/api/files/copy` `{sessionId,srcPath,destPath,move?}` | Recursive copy or move (cp -R / mv) |
| GET    | `/api/blackboard/tasks?sessionId=` | All blackboard tasks for a session (polled by LiveBlackboardBar every 3s) |
| GET    | `/api/blackboard/task/:id` | Single task with plan steps and audit history |
| GET    | `/api/deploy/readiness` | 6-point pre-deploy checklist (SQLite, DNA, provider keys, MongoDB, stasis tasks, sandbox flavor) |

## Silent Operator Protocol (v7.0)

Nexus AI operates silently — all code is written directly to sandbox files using structured marker format. Chat shows only clean status text, with deep details in expandable sections:

- **Neural Logic** — Nexus's thought process (collapsed by default)
- **Action Chain** — Step-by-step plan (expanded by default)
- **File Context** — Files read + files modified with "View" button to open in editor
- **Ghost Terminal** — Commands executed inline with output, copyable, auto-expanded on error
- **Visual Verification** — Screenshot of preview after build

### AI Response Marker Format

```
[NEXUS:THOUGHT]reasoning[/NEXUS:THOUGHT]
[NEXUS:CHAIN]Step 1: ...|Step 2: ...[/NEXUS:CHAIN]
[NEXUS:READ]filename.ts[/NEXUS:READ]
[NEXUS:FILE:path/to/file.tsx]complete file content[/NEXUS:FILE]
[NEXUS:TERMINAL]npm install[/NEXUS:TERMINAL]
[NEXUS:SCREENSHOT]verify[/NEXUS:SCREENSHOT]
Visible summary text to user (no code blocks)
```

### SSE Event Protocol

Backend sends structured events to frontend:
- `nexus_streaming` — keep-alive ping with status text
- `nexus_thought` — reasoning (goes to Neural Logic accordion)
- `nexus_chain` — action chain steps
- `nexus_file_read` — files analyzed
- `nexus_file_write` — file written to sandbox `{path, size}`
- `nexus_terminal` — command result `{cmd, output, success, retried, fixedCmd}`
- `nexus_screenshot` — visual verification filename
- `nexus_summary` — clean visible text for chat message

## Quad-System Integration

All four systems are hard-linked via WebSocket broadcast signals:

| Signal | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `__REFRESH_FS__` | File Explorer re-scans sandbox |
| `__OPEN_PREVIEW__` | Preview panel opens automatically |
| `__REFRESH_PREVIEW__` | Preview iframe reloads |

## Build Protocol A to Z

Nexus follows a 5-phase build protocol for every project:
1. **Analyze** — Scan existing files, understand request
2. **Plan** — Write THOUGHT + CHAIN, report to user
3. **Execute** — Write all files, run terminal commands
4. **Verify** — Screenshot preview, self-correct visual issues
5. **Report** — Summarize what was built

## Terminal Autonomy + Self-Correction

Autopilot and AI service both implement self-correction:
- npm install fails → retry with `--legacy-peer-deps`, then `--force`
- Port in use → autopilot auto-increments port
- Module not found → auto-install the missing package
- Max 3 retry attempts before reporting failure

## Sandbox Isolation

Each session gets a fully isolated sandbox:
- Path: `sandbox/projects/{sessionId}/`
- Shell: dedicated bash process per session
- Path traversal prevention: `guardPath()` on all API endpoints
- Auto-initialization: `Nexus.md` copied on session creation

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 20 + TypeScript (tsx for dev)
- **Frontend:** React 18, Tailwind v4, motion/react, lucide-react
- **AI Providers:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview → Gemini 2.0 Flash → Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite → GitHub GPT-4o → Groq Llama-3.3-70B → HuggingFace Llama-3.2
- **Editor:** @uiw/react-codemirror + CodeMirror language extensions
- **Color Palette:** `#d4af37` (Nexus Gold), `#00f2ff` (Nexus Cyan), `#050508` (Deep Black)
